              <p>
                <b style="font-size: 30px;">About Us – XENESIS</b> <br> <br>
                Welcome to XENESIS, a platform where intelligence, strategy, and teamwork take center stage. We are the minds behind X-Mock SuperAgents, a thrilling event designed to test wit, problem-solving, and quick thinking through a series of engaging challenges. Our goal is to create an immersive experience where participants push their cognitive limits, decode complex puzzles, and work together to emerge victorious. <br> <br>

                At XENESIS, we believe that intelligence goes beyond memorization and textbook knowledge. True brilliance lies in adaptability, critical thinking, and the ability to connect the dots under pressure. With this philosophy in mind, we have crafted X-Mock SuperAgents, a competition that brings out the best in every participant by testing their analytical skills, logical reasoning, and teamwork in an exhilarating, high-stakes setting. <br> <br>

                <b style="font-size: 30px;">The Genesis of XENESIS</b> <br> <br>
                Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to create an event that celebrates intellect, curiosity, and strategic thinking. In a world where competitive exams and theoretical knowledge often take the spotlight, we wanted to offer something different—an experience that is engaging, thought-provoking, and rewarding. <br> <br>

                Thus, X-Mock SuperAgents was born. This event is not just a competition but an adventure—a chance for participants to step into the shoes of elite problem-solvers, facing mysteries and challenges that require more than just intelligence. From decoding secret messages to solving intricate puzzles, every round is designed to be a test of skill, patience, and mental agility. <br> <br>

                Our team, composed of innovative thinkers, puzzle enthusiasts, and event planners, has worked tirelessly to design a competition that is both challenging and fun. Each of us brings a unique set of skills—ranging from logical reasoning and creative storytelling to meticulous planning and execution. Together, we have built an event that is not just about winning but about learning, growing, and enjoying the thrill of the chase. <br> <br>

                <b style="font-size: 30px;">The Challenge: X-Mock SuperAgents</b> <br> <br>

                X-Mock SuperAgents is structured into three intense rounds, each designed to filter out the sharpest minds and the most effective teams. <br> <br>

                <b>Round 1: The High-Stakes Quiz </b> <br>
                The journey begins with a rapid-fire knowledge test, where teams must answer a series of challenging questions in just 15 seconds per question. The topics range from general knowledge and logic puzzles to riddles and problem-solving scenarios. This round is designed to test participants’ ability to think quickly and accurately under pressure. <br> <br>

                Only the 10 best-performing teams will advance to the next stage, proving their quick-thinking skills and knowledge. <br> <br>

                <b>Round 2: The Puzzle Showdown</b> <br>
                With only 10 teams remaining, the competition heats up. The second round is a 2-minute puzzle-solving challenge that demands exceptional teamwork, analytical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Teams must decode cryptic messages, crack codes, and solve intricate puzzles before time runs out. <br> <br>

                This round is a true test of collaboration—teams that communicate effectively and divide tasks efficiently have the best chance of success. At the end of this stage, only 7 teams will advance, inching closer to victory. <br> <br>

                <b>Round 3: The Ultimate Clue Hunt</b> <br>
                The final and most intense stage of the competition is a 20-minute clue hunt, where teams must follow a series of interconnected clues, each one more perplexing than the last. Participants must rely on logic, deduction, and observational skills to unravel the mystery and find the final solution. <br> <br>

                This round is designed to simulate real-world problem-solving scenarios, where missing a single detail can mean failure. Only 3 teams will emerge victorious, proving themselves as the ultimate masterminds of the challenge. <br> <br>
